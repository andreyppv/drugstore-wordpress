== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to fix fields that are not showing on checkout page properly? = 
Usually this is an CSS issue. If your theme comes with the option to input your very own custom CSS, you can use the abbreviation field name as part of the CSS code to set the fields in the way that you want. 

Example :
`#myfield1_field {
	float: right;
}`

= How do I review the data from the custom fields? = 
Your order data can be reviewed in each order. By default your "Custom Fields" section should be showing allowing you to see the custom fields data.
If the fields are not showing, follow these steps:

1. Go to your desired Order.
2. Click "Screen Options"
3. Check "Custom Fields"
4. Scroll down till you see "Custom Fields" section.

= How do you access saved data to be used with WooCommerce PDF Invoices & Packing Slips? = 
The above plugin requests that you code the fields in the template. To access the saved data, use the abbreviation name of the field. As we are using the first abbreviation field as an example. Where "myfield1" is the abbreviation name, and "My custom field:" is the label.

Example:
`<?php $wpo_wcpdf->custom_field('myfield1', 'My custom field:'); ?>`
