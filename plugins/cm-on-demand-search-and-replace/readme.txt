Searches and replaces the words, phrases and HTML in real time throughout the content without changing the database.

== Description ==

The CM On demand search and replace tool for WordPress allows you to easily change the content of posts, pages, comments, titles and excerpts just before they are displayed on the front end, without making changes in the WordPress database. This is a real-time find and replace tool that applies any number of pre-defined rules after a page is generated by WordPress, but before it is sent to a user’s browser. This creates dynamic rules that replace html and text generated by your theme and plugins before a page is delivered to a user’s browser.
